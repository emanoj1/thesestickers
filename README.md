# These Stickers

**These Stickers** is a static website created to showcase my handmade sticker collection - I drew them, printed them on a sticker paper, laminated it, and then cut to shape.

Visitors can browse through the collection, read about the creator's story, check shop policies, and use a contact form to get in touch or place wholesale inquiries. The site links out to a Ko-fi store for purchases.
